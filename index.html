<p>
					To be sure, live events are back in India as covid curbs ease across states, reviving options for artists, sponsors and event organisers. Comedy events are the most popular, followed by music, including those by new and independent artists.
The current focus is on small gigs at nightclubs, restaurants, lounge bars and malls, Anil Makhija, chief operating officer, live entertainment and venues at ticketing site BookMyShowhad said in an earlier interview. “This strategy of enabling multiple smaller capacity events at smaller venues with a high focus on safety protocols has been very effective. Capacity caps remain in some cities, but BookMyShow hopes that pent-up demand will drive live entertainment. Its live events cover comedy, music, plays, adventure and other genres. Capacity for most events remains under 500, with relatively higher average ticket prices, close to that of international artists in some cases. This is because capacities are lower and demand is high, Makhija had said. Conversations with new and existing brand partners reveal the start of budgets being marked out for sponsorship spending. Brands that look keenly at live entertainment as a relevant spending avenue for growth and partnership include Edu-tech, e-wallets, banking and the larger fintech avenue, e-commerce including lifestyle and FMCG, and auto brands.
